clusterIP: 
        it can not communicate outside the cluster [comminucation between pods]
           ex: 
              /wordpress /mysql- clusterIP 
               mysql comminucate with wordpress internally using an IP
NodePort: 
        given for the TEAM [tester/devlopers] to make changes
LoadBalancer:
        exposed to outside the world 
           here normally we do not need to use [nodeport] because cloud provider will provide external IP
