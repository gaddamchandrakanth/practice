  ❌ What Does “Not Installing Dependencies” Mean?

       It means your Docker image doesn't contain the software or libraries your app needs to run.
            So when the container starts, it crashes or fails because something critical is missing.

it means that if we are cfreating an image of own then as per the ENTRYPOINT  dependency should be installed in it 

ex: 
    FROM         UBUNTU
    RUN          apt-get update
    RUN          apt-get install -y  nginx 
    EXPOSE       80
    ENTRYPOINT   ["nginx","-g","daemon off;"]
